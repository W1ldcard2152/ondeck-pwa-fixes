# OnDeck PWA Fixes

This repository contains fixes for two critical issues in the OnDeck application:

1. Service Worker not being active (PWA installation not working)
2. Tasks Table not displaying in the Tasks page

## Issue 1: Service Worker Not Being Active

The service worker was properly defined but wasn't correctly registered or maintained its active state in the application. This prevented the PWA from being installable.

### Solutions Implemented:

1. **Enhanced Service Worker Hook (`useServiceWorker.ts`)**
   - Created a robust React hook to manage service worker registration, updates, and lifecycle
   - Added error handling and status reporting
   - Implemented lifecycle event callbacks (onSuccess, onUpdate, onError)
   - Provided utilities to update and unregister the service worker if needed

2. **Updated InstallPWA Component (`InstallPWA.tsx`)**
   - Integrated with the new service worker hook
   - Added proper checks for service worker registration before showing the install button
   - Enhanced error handling for better debugging
   - Improved UX by showing appropriate messages based on installation state

3. **Enhanced Service Worker Implementation (`sw.js`)**
   - Updated service worker with improved error handling
   - Added proper `clients.claim()` to ensure immediate control of pages
   - Implemented better caching strategies for different resource types
   - Added activity monitoring to keep the service worker active
   - Improved logging for better debugging

4. **Integrated Service Worker with App Layout (`DesktopLayout.tsx`)**
   - Centralized service worker registration in the main layout component
   - Added proper initialization on app startup
   - Implemented status monitoring and optional user notifications for updates
   - Added debug logging for development mode

5. **Enhanced Status Monitoring (`PWAStatus.tsx`)**
   - Updated the status component to use the new service worker hook
   - Added more comprehensive status reporting
   - Provided better debug information during development

## Issue 2: Tasks Table Not Displaying

The Tasks Table component wasn't rendering correctly despite data being available. This was due to various issues in the component implementation.

### Solutions Implemented:

1. **Fixed TaskTable Component (`TaskTable.tsx`)**
   - Added proper validation of the input data (ensuring tasks array is valid)
   - Implemented defensive rendering logic with fallbacks for missing or invalid data
   - Added debug logging to track component rendering and data flow
   - Fixed conditional rendering to ensure UI elements appear properly based on data availability
   - Added a placeholder message when no tasks are found instead of rendering nothing

2. **Added Error Recovery Mechanism**
   - Added explicit error handling and user feedback when tasks can't be displayed
   - Implemented fallback UI for different error states
   - Added explicit type checking for arrays and objects to prevent rendering errors

## How to Apply These Fixes

1. **Service Worker Files**:
   - Replace `public/sw.js` with the enhanced version from `fixes/sw.js`
   - Add the `useServiceWorker.ts` hook to your hooks directory

2. **Component Updates**:
   - Replace `InstallPWA.tsx`, `PWAStatus.tsx`, and `DesktopLayout.tsx` with the fixed versions
   - Update `TaskTable.tsx` with the fixed version to resolve the tasks display issue

## Testing the Fixes

After applying the fixes:

1. **For Service Worker / PWA Installation**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools > Application > Service Workers and verify it shows as "active"
   - Check that the "Install" button appears when appropriate
   - Test the installation flow on desktop and mobile devices
   - Verify offline functionality works as expected

2. **For Tasks Table Display**:
   - Navigate to the Tasks page and confirm the table displays correctly
   - Verify that tasks with different statuses appear in their appropriate sections
   - Test sorting, filtering, and other interactions with the table

## Future Improvements

1. **PWA Enhancements**:
   - Implement background sync for offline actions
   - Add push notification support for task reminders
   - Improve cache management for better offline experience

2. **Task Table Enhancements**:
   - Add optimistic UI updates for better responsiveness
   - Implement virtualized scrolling for large task lists
   - Add more sophisticated filtering and sorting options
